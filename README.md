# Personal Information Program

This repository contains a simple Python program that collects and displays personal information entered by the user. It uses basic principles of lexical analysis, parsing, and interpretation similar to a simple compiler design.

## Components

### `compiler.py`

This file contains the implementation of the interpreter for evaluating arithmetic expressions and unary operations based on the user input. The Interpreter class defined here traverses the abstract syntax tree (AST) generated by the parser to compute results.

### `lexer.py`

The Lexer class in this file tokenizes the user input text into meaningful tokens. It identifies and categorizes tokens such as numbers, operators, parentheses, and handles errors for illegal characters encountered in the input.

### `parser_.py`

The Parser class in this file parses the tokens produced by the lexer into an abstract syntax tree (AST). It defines methods for parsing expressions, terms, factors, and handles operator precedence to correctly represent the structure of arithmetic expressions.

### `nodes.py`

This file defines the different node classes used to construct the AST. These include:

- **NumberNode**: Represents a numerical value in the AST.
- **BinaryNode**: Represents a binary operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo) in the AST.
- **UnaryNode**: Represents unary operations (positive and negative signs) in the AST.

These nodes collectively form the structure that the parser builds to represent the user's input expression.

### `main.py`

This file contains the main program logic. It interacts with the user to collect their name, age, and a brief introduction, then displays this information formatted as specified. Key functionalities include:

1. **User Interaction**: Prompts the user to enter their name, age, and introduction using the `input()` function.
  
2. **Error Handling**: Catches exceptions such as type errors or illegal characters encountered during parsing or evaluation and prints appropriate error messages.

3. **Expression Evaluation**: Utilizes the Lexer, Parser, and Interpreter classes to parse and evaluate expressions constructed from user input strings.

4. **Output Formatting**: Constructs output strings using Python's f-strings to concatenate user input with predefined labels (e.g., "Name:", "Age:", "Introduction:") and displays them.

## Usage

To run the program, execute `python3 main.py` in your terminal. Follow the prompts to enter your personal information, and the program will display it in a formatted manner.
